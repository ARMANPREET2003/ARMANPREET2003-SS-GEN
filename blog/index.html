          Punjab, the land of five rivers, is a vibrant tapestry of traditions and culture. Its unique identity shines
          through its folk dances, festivals, and deep connection to the land. Lok Naach such as <strong>Bhangra</strong>
          and <strong>Gidha</strong> are captivating expressions of joy, with Bhangra symbolizing the energy of boys
          and Gidha portraying the grace and storytelling of girls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Festivals in Punjab, like <strong>Vaisakhi</strong>, are celebrated with immense joy, reflecting the gratitude
          of farmers for their harvests. The spiritual significance of festivals and the worship of crops underline the
          reverence for nature and hard work in Punjab's culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a proud Punjabi, I cherish these traditions and the warmth of my community. Punjab's vibrant culture is
          a celebration of life, bringing people together in love and harmony.
